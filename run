# run the script via `ros2 run` (for python scripts a simple symlink would also
# work but using `ros2 run` works for C++ executables as well)

# Examples for Stage 1
# ros2 run rrc_example_package real_move_up_and_down "$@"
ros2 run rrc_example_package real_trajectory_example_with_gym "$@"

# Example for Stage 2
# ros2 run rrc_example_package dice_example_with_gym "$@"
